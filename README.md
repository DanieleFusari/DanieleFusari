THIS IS ME
CREATIVE ADVENTURES
I have been self teaching software development skills for the past three years. I have found this type of role would really allow me to use these skills and also enable me to learn much more.
I am a keen programmer and I have found not only this has been a hobby but I would like this to be a role for me to progress into.

I am currently a Broadband Tech advisor and have found that this has given me a really good knowledge base; however, I am looking for a challenge that suits my abilities. I would really appreciate an opportunity like this.
I am aware I donâ€™t have all of the qualifications or experience requested though, I am willing to attend extra courses in my own time, where I can demonstrate my creativity and strong work ethics.
